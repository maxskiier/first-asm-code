This 6502 assembly code is designed with and should be compiled with the cc65 compiler/assembler suite. The link to their repo can be found here:
https://github.com/cc65/cc65

This code has a build script that will automatically use ca65 and ld65 to assemble and link the code. It should be placed in the same directory as ca65, ld65, and the code, unless you
are using make.sh.

You can do whatever you want with this code. Mostly since this is a showcase rather than a program with actual function. 
If you have any comments, please feel free to reach out. Thanks!
