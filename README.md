This 6502 assembly code is designed with and should be compiled with the cc65 compiler/assembler suite. The link to their repo can be found here:
https://github.com/cc65/cc65

To use 65C02 mode when compiling, use "-D C02=1" when running ca65. This will swap any file that was made to be compatible with the original 6502 for its more efficient 65C02 counterpart.

You can do whatever you want with this code. Mostly since this is a showcase rather than a program with actual function. 
If you have any comments, please feel free to reach out. Thanks!
