This 65C02 assembly code is designed with and should be compiled with the cc65 compiler/assembler suite. The link can be found here:

There is no license for this code. You can do whatever you want with it, I don't really care. Mostly since is is a showcase rather than a program with actual function. 
If you have any comments, please feel free to reach out. Thanks!
